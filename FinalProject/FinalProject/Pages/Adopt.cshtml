                        We typically get all of our adoptable pets from local police stations that are found as strays. We have a stray holding period and then will vet them and adopt them out. If for some reason there is a pet that is not adoptable due to health issues, behavior, or any other underlying reasons, we will then work with local rescues to find these pets a great and loving home.

                        When animals arrive at our center, they receive examinations by a veterinarian and daily observation by their caretakers.
                        <br>
                        Vaccinations: The vaccinations decrease the possibility and severity of an illness, but take some time and boosters to become fully effective, especially in a young animal.
                        <br>
                        Parasites: We test for parasites and routinely de-worm animals as a preventative while they are in our care and provide treatment when necessary.
                        <br>
                        We do everything in our power to detect and treat illness prior to an adoption; however, the animals we rescue are homeless and typically receive little or no medical attention prior to arriving at our facility. Plus after adoption, the stress of the transition into a new home can frequently cause a pet that was healthy on the day of adoption to wake up the next morning sick. Puppies younger than six months are more vulnerable since they do not have the fully-functioning immune system of an older animal.

                        We update the pets shown online as often as possible. Adopted pets are removed and new pets are added. It is highly likely that a pet shown online is available. However, our goal is to place homeless pets in permanent homes and holding them would potentially deny them a home while we wait for someone who may or may not show up and may or may not actually adopt the pet. If you see a pet online that seems right for you, please fill out the application and call our number and you will be given the up-to-the-minute information on the pet’s availability. If still available, we recommend you come in immediately to meet the pet if you decide that you want to adopt.
